                <h2>Module Components</h2>
                <h3>SurfaceRunoff</h3>
                <p>Calculates surface runoff based on soil properties, moisture levels, and urban vs. rural settings. Takes into account frozen soil layers and the impact of snow and ice on runoff.</p>

                <h3>Infiltration</h3>
                <p>Computes infiltration into the surface soil layer minus the evaporation. Handles partitioning of moisture fluxes between soil and surface water (h2osfc). Considers modified infiltration schemes and water inputs from various sources, including irrigation.</p>

                <h3>WaterTable</h3>
                <p>Calculates the water table, accounting for aquifer recharge without drainage. Determines the layer containing the water table and computes the specific yield for the aquifer. Handles perched water tables and frost tables, updating soil moisture and ice content based on condensation and sublimation processes.</p>

                <h3>Drainage</h3>
                <p>Calculates subsurface drainage, including both bottom and topographic control drainage. Considers factors like hydraulic conductivity, soil matric potential, and the effect of ice on soil permeability. Uses different approaches for vegetated vs. urban land units and adjusts water table depth accordingly.</p>

                <h3>DrainageVSFM</h3>
                <p>Specific version of the drainage calculation that uses a different soil moisture movement model. Includes additional variables and parameters for more detailed simulation of soil hydrology processes.</p>

                <h3>Key Variables and Parameters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bounds: Represents the spatial bounds of the calculation.</li>
                    <li>SoilHydrologyType, SoilStateType, WaterfluxType: Custom types that encapsulate various hydrological, state, and water flux parameters.</li>
                    <li>dtime: Time step for the calculations.</li>
                    <li>num_hydrologyc, filter_hydrologyc, num_urbanc, filter_urbanc: Arrays and counters for filtering and processing hydrological and urban column points.</li>
                    <li>h2osoi_liq, h2osoi_ice, h2osfc: Soil moisture variables representing liquid water, ice content, and surface water.</li>
                    <li>zwt, zwt_perched: Variables for the depth of the water table and perched water table.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Detailed Calculations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Surface Runoff: Considers soil moisture, urban impervious surfaces, and snow cover to compute runoff.</li>
                    <li>Infiltration: Uses soil properties, topographic features, and water inputs to calculate how much water infiltrates the soil.</li>
                    <li>Water Table Calculation: Determines the depth of the water table based on aquifer recharge, specific yield, and soil moisture conditions.</li>
                    <li>Subsurface Drainage: Accounts for various soil layers, ice content, and hydraulic conductivity to compute drainage.</li>
                </ul>
